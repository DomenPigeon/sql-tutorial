# SQL Tutorial

## Bare basics

For basics follow the [SQL Bolt tutorial](https://sqlbolt.com/).
Then you can set up a postgres database in podman (or docker) and try out the exercises below.

## Setup

### Postgres setup

```shell
podman run --replace --name postgres-tutorial -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=tutorial -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
podman exec -it postgres-tutorial psql -U postgres -d tutorial
```

### Tables setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees
(
    employee_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    project_id    INT
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments
(
    department_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects
(
    project_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(100),
    budget       DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### Sample data setup

```sql
-- Insert data into departments
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name)
VALUES (1, 'HR'),
       (2, 'IT'),
       (3, 'Finance'),
       (4, 'Marketing'),
       (5, 'Sales');

-- Insert data into projects
INSERT INTO projects (project_id, project_name, budget)
VALUES (1, 'Project Alpha', 10000.00),
       (2, 'Project Beta', 20000.00),
       (3, 'Project Gamma', 15000.00),
       (4, 'Project Delta', 5000.00),
       (5, 'Project Epsilon', 25000.00);

-- Insert data into employees
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, project_id)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1, 101),
       (2, 'Bob', 2, 102),
       (3, 'Charlie', 3, 103),
       (4, 'David', 2, 101),
       (5, 'Eve', 1, NULL),
       (6, 'Frank', NULL, 103),
       (7, 'Grace', 4, 104),
       (8, 'Hank', 5, 105),
       (9, 'Ivy', 5, NULL),
       (10, 'Jack', NULL, NULL);
```

FROM employees
WHERE department_id IS NULL
   OR project_id IS NULL;
```

</details>

### 3. List all employees with their department names and project names

**Instructions**: Show all employees with their respective department names and project names. Include employees without a department or project.

<details>

         LEFT JOIN projects p ON e.project_id = p.project_id
GROUP BY d.department_name, p.project_name;
```

</details>

### 6. Add 'side_projects' table

**Instructions**: Create a new table called `side_projects` with the following columns:

- `project_id` with type `INT` and primary key
- `project_name` with type `VARCHAR(100)`
- `budget` with type `DECIMAL(10, 2)`
- `volunteers_count` with type `INT`
- `payment_status` with type `BOOL`

Then create 3 new side projects with the following details:

- Project name: 'Project Zeta', Budget: 5000.00, Volunteers: 3, Payment: TRUE
- Project name: 'Project Theta', Budget: 8000.00, Volunteers: 5, Payment: FALSE
- Project name: 'Project Iota', Budget: 3000.00, Volunteers: 2, Payment: FALSE

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE side_projects
(
    project_id       INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name     VARCHAR(100),
    budget           DECIMAL(10, 2),
    volunteers_count INT,
    payment_status   BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO side_projects (project_id, project_name, budget, volunteers_count, payment_status)
VALUES (1, 'Project Zeta', 5000.00, 3, TRUE),
       (2, 'Project Theta', 8000.00, 5, FALSE),
       (3, 'Project Iota', 3000.00, 2, FALSE);
```

</details>

### 7. Add employees_side_projects table

**Instructions**: Because each employee can work on multiple side projects,
we need to create a new table called `employees_side_projects` with the following columns:

- `employee_id` with type `INT`
- `project_id` with type `INT`

Then assign the following employees to the side projects:

- `employee_id` 1 to `side_project_id` 1, 2
- `employee_id` 2 to `side_project_id` 1
- `employee_id` 3 to `side_project_id` 1, 2, 3
- `employee_id` 7 to `side_project_id` 3
- `employee_id` 8 to `side_project_id` 2, 3
- `employee_id` 10 to `side_project_id` 1, 3

**NOTES**: The `employee_id` and `project_id` columns should be a composite primary key.
The `employee_id` and `project_id` columns should be a foreign key references to the `employees` and `side_projects` tables respectively.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees_side_projects
(
    employee_id     INT,
    side_project_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, side_project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees (employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (side_project_id) REFERENCES side_projects (project_id)
);

INSERT INTO employees_side_projects (employee_id, side_project_id)
VALUES (1, 1),
       (1, 2),
       (2, 1),
       (3, 1),
       (3, 2),
       (3, 3),
       (7, 3),
       (8, 2),
       (8, 3),
       (10, 1),
       (10, 3);

```
